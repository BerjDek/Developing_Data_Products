## R Markdown
 I created a map of the cities all the cities i lived in.
 dplyr and leaflet packages were loaded however the echo was set on false to reduce clutter



```{r map}
md_cities <- data.frame(name = c("Zahle", "Beirut", "Istanbul", "Tallinn", 
                                 "Maastricht", "Barcelona"),
                        pop = c(200000, 1900000, 15500000, 440000, 122000,
                                1600000),
                        latitude = c(33.8464, 33.8938, 41.0082, 59.4370, 50.8514, 41.3851),
                        longitude = c(35.9042, 35.5018, 28.9784, 24.7536, 5.6915, 2.1734))

leaflet(data = md_cities) %>% 
addTiles() %>%
addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(md_cities$pop) * 30, lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude)
```
