## Employment Rate Across Countries in Different Years
In order to create this plot, i downloaded a dataset from gapminder, and then selected a few random countries.
The plot aims to show the employment rate of those between 15 and 24 through out the years.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


data <- read.csv("ddf.csv") %>% 
filter(geo %in% c("afg", "arg", "arm", "bel", "chn", "deu", "egy", "swe"))%>%
  rename(Employment_Rate = aged_15_24_employment_rate_percent)


plot_ly(data, x = ~time, y = ~Employment_Rate, color = ~geo, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
```
